Introduction
This repository aims to be a practical, repeatable reference for AI engineers who need a solid API layer on top of machine learning workflows. It blends three core technologies in a cohesive way:

- FastAPI for fast, scalable web endpoints with automatic docs.
- Pydantic for strict data validation, settings management, and model schemas.
- SQLAlchemy for reliable data access, both in Core form and via ORM.

Why this stack makes sense for AI projects
- Speed and clarity: FastAPI gives you performance along with an intuitive development experience.
- Data integrity: Pydantic ensures inputs and outputs stay well-typed and predictable.
- Flexible data access: SQLAlchemy supports both low-level SQL concerns (Core) and high-level domain models (ORM).
- Production readiness: Clear separation of concerns, testable components, and straightforward deployment paths.

Getting Started: FastAPI Basics
This section gets you up and running with a minimal FastAPI app, showing how to wire endpoints, handle path and query parameters, and validate request bodies with Pydantic.

Environment and prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Pip for installing dependencies
- A terminal to run commands

Install essentials
- The core stack at a minimum includes FastAPI and Uvicorn to serve the app, plus Pydantic for data validation.
- SQLAlchemy is added for database access.

Commands
- Create a project folder and a virtual environment.
- Install dependencies:

  pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic sqlalchemy

First FastAPI application (Hello World)
A simple endpoint that returns a greeting and demonstrates the automatic OpenAPI docs.

Code (main.py)
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, AI world!"}

If you run the app
- Start the server: uvicorn main:app --reload
- Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the response
- The interactive docs sit at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Path Parameters and Query Parameters
- Path parameters extract parts of the URL path.
- Query parameters come from the query string.

Code example
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: str = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

Request Body with Pydantic
- Use a Pydantic model to validate incoming JSON payloads.

Code example
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    in_stock: bool = True

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(item: Item):
    return {"item": item}

Starting and testing
- Run as before with uvicorn.
- Use a tool like curl or Postman to POST a JSON payload to /items/.

Pydantic: Data Validation and Settings Management
Pydantic helps you define schemas, validate data, and manage configuration settings.

Defining Models
- Use BaseModel to define payload schemas.
- Use Field to add metadata or default values.

Code example
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=20)
    email: str
    age: int = Field(..., ge=0, le=120)

Data Validation and Serialization
- Pydantic handles both validation on input and serialization on output.
- When you return a Pydantic model, FastAPI converts it to JSON automatically.

Custom Validators
- You can add validators to enforce cross-field constraints or custom checks.

Code example
from pydantic import validator

class Product(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    discount: float = 0.0

    @validator("discount")
    def discount_must_be_valid(cls, v, values):
        price = values.get("price")
        if price is not None and (v < 0 or v > price):
            raise ValueError("Discount must be between 0 and the price")
        return v

Settings Management
- Use BaseSettings to read environment variables or .env files.

Code example
from pydantic import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_name: str = "AI Deployment App"
    db_url: str = "sqlite:///./test.db"
    debug: bool = False

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

settings = Settings()

SQLAlchemy Core: Database Interaction
Core focuses on expressing SQL constructs directly. It is great for flexible, explicit SQL generation without ORM overhead.

Installation and Setup
- Install SQLAlchemy (and a database driver if needed).

Code example
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table, Column, Integer, String
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///./example.db", echo=True)
metadata = MetaData()

Define Tables (Metadata)
- Tables are defined as SQLAlchemy Core objects.
- Use explicit Column definitions.

Code example
users = Table(
    "users", metadata,
    Column("id", Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column("name", String(50)),
    Column("email", String(120), unique=True)
)

Creating tables
metadata.create_all(engine)

Connecting and Executing Queries
- Use a connection to run statements.
- Core uses SQL expressions for CRUD.

Code example
with engine.connect() as conn:
    ins = users.insert().values(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com")
    result = conn.execute(ins)
    conn.commit()

    sel = users.select()
    result = conn.execute(sel)
    for row in result:
        print(row)

CRUD Operations with Core
- Create, Read, Update, Delete via core expressions.
- Use transactions for safety and integrity.

Code example
with engine.begin() as conn:
    conn.execute(users.update().where(users.c.name == "Alice").values(email="alice@newdomain.com"))
    conn.execute(users.delete().where(users.c.name == "Alice"))

Best practices for Core
- Favor parameterized statements to avoid SQL injection.
- Use metadata and explicit types for portability.

SQLAlchemy ORM: Object-Relational Mapping
The ORM maps Python classes to database tables. It provides a convenient abstraction for working with data as objects.

Defining ORM Models
- Use declarative_base to define a mapped class.

Code example
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String, unique=True)

Session Management
- Use a session to manage transactions and object persistence.

Code example
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///./orm_example.db")
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

Basic CRUD Operations with ORM
- Create: add objects and commit.
- Read: query with session.
- Update: modify attributes and commit.
- Delete: remove objects and commit.

Code example
session = Session()
user = User(name="Bob", email="bob@example.com")
session.add(user)
session.commit()

# Read
users = session.query(User).all()

# Update
user.name = "Robert"
session.commit()

# Delete
session.delete(user)
session.commit()

Relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)
- Relationships model real-world connections between entities.
- Use relationship and back_populates to keep both sides in sync.

Code example (One-to-Many)
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

class Post(Base):
    __tablename__ = "posts"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String)
    author_id = Column(Integer)
    author = relationship("User", back_populates="posts")

User.posts = relationship("Post", order_by=Post.id, back_populates="author")

Code example (Many-to-Many)
from sqlalchemy import Table, ForeignKey

association = Table(
    "association",
    Base.metadata,
    Column("left_id", ForeignKey("left.id")),
    Column("right_id", ForeignKey("right.id"))
)

class Left(Base):
    __tablename__ = "left"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    right = relationship("Right", secondary=association, back_populates="left")

class Right(Base):
    __tablename__ = "right"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    left = relationship("Left", secondary=association, back_populates="right")

Session and performance
- Use scoped sessions in multi-threaded environments.
- Manage sessions with context managers where possible.

Patterns for ORM in APIs
- Convert ORM models to Pydantic schemas for response payloads.
- Use explicit loading strategies to optimize queries.
- Keep business logic in service layers rather than in the endpoint handlers.

AI Deployment Patterns
This section covers patterns tailored for AI projects that use FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy together.

Inference endpoints
- Build endpoints that receive input data, validate with Pydantic, run inference in a safe isolation layer, and return results.

Example shape
- Input: a JSON payload with features or prompts
- Output: predictions, scores, or metadata

Data validation and model inputs
- Use strict schemas to ensure inputs match the modelâ€™s expectations.
- Provide helpful error messages for invalid data.

Data persistence
- Store metadata about inferences, such as input shapes, model version, and timestamps.
- Consider separate read and write databases for scale and reliability.

Versioning and model registry
- Track model versions and associated metadata in the database.
- Expose endpoints to list available models, their schemas, and performance metrics.

Observability
- Log request/response sizes, inference times, and error rates.
- Use metrics to monitor health and performance.

Project Structure and Package Layout
A clear layout helps teams grow a project without friction.

Sample code snippets you can adapt
- FastAPI app bootstrap
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.api.endpoints import items, inference

app = FastAPI(title="AI Deployment API", version="1.0.0")
app.include_router(items.router)
app.include_router(inference.router)

- Pydantic schema for request input
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
class InferenceInput(BaseModel):
    features: list[float] = Field(..., min_items=1, max_items=1024)
    model_version: str = Field("latest")

- SQLAlchemy ORM model
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float

Base = declarative_base()

class InferenceRecord(Base):
    __tablename__ = "inference_records"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    model_version = Column(String)
    input_hash = Column(String)
    result = Column(String)
    timestamp = Column(String)

- Inference service (high level)
class InferenceService:
    def __init__(self, model_loader, db_session):
        self.model_loader = model_loader
        self.db_session = db_session

    def run_inference(self, inputs):
        model = self.model_loader.load(inputs.model_version)
        outputs = model.predict(inputs.features)
        self._save_record(inputs, outputs)
        return outputs

- Dependency injection pattern
from fastapi import Depends

def get_session():
    session = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield session
    finally:
        session.close()

@app.get("/health")
def health_check():
    return {"status": "ok"}

- Validation of complex inputs
from pydantic import conlist
class FeatureVector(BaseModel):
    vector: conlist(float, min_items=1, max_items=1024)

- Endpoints wiring
from fastapi import APIRouter
from app.schemas import InferenceInput

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/infer")
def infer(payload: InferenceInput):
    # run inference
    return {"output": "result"}

Testing and Quality
- Use pytest for tests.
- Use FastAPI's TestClient to exercise endpoints.
- Mock long-running inference calls to keep tests fast.

Code example (tests)
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_health():
    res = client.get("/health")
    assert res.status_code == 200
    assert res.json()["status"] == "ok"

Project Structure and Package Layout (Deep Dive)
- Monorepo style vs. modular structure
- Naming conventions for modules and packages
- Separation between API, domain logic, and data access

API design principles
- Use explicit endpoints for resources (items, inferences).
- Keep payloads small and explicit.
- Return meaningful error messages with status codes.

Validation strategy
- Centralize validation in Pydantic models.
- Use custom validators for cross-field checks.

Data access strategy
- Use ORM for most business logic; use Core for batch operations or reporting queries.
- Keep data access abstracted behind a repository layer where possible.

Configuration and Settings
- Centralize environment configuration to reduce duplication.
- Load defaults with sensible values and override with environment variables.

Code example (config)
from pydantic import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    app_name: str = "AI Deployment API"
    host: str = "0.0.0.0"
    port: int = 8000
    database_url: str = "sqlite:///./ai_deploy.db"

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"

settings = Settings()

Development workflow and Testing
- Use a clean environment for each run to avoid state leakage.
- Run tests automatically in CI with a simple workflow.

CI hints
- Run unit tests with pytest.
- Run linting with flake8 or mypy for type checks.
- Run integration tests against a local database.

Sample testing approach
- Test input validation errors
- Test successful inference path with mocked models
- Test database writes and reads in a test DB

Deployment and Operations
Docker and containerization
- A minimal Dockerfile should install dependencies, copy source, and run uvicorn.
- Consider multi-stage builds to reduce image size.

Example Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip wheel --no-deps --progress-bar=off -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

Docker Compose
- A docker-compose.yml can wire a web service and a database.

Example docker-compose.yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./ai_deploy.db
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ai
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ai_pass
      POSTGRES_DB: ai_deploy

Deployment best practices
- Use a small, reproducible image.
- Pin dependencies to versions using a lock file.
- Use health checks to monitor service readiness.
- Separate database from app for resilience and scaling.

Security and Reliability
- Validate all inputs; never trust client data.
- Use HTTPS in production and protect endpoints with authentication.
- Implement rate limiting and access control where needed.
- Log security events and monitor for anomalies.

Authentication
- Simple API key or OAuth patterns can be added.
- Store credentials securely and rotate keys.

Error handling
- Use FastAPI's exception handlers to return consistent error responses.
- Provide actionable error messages, not just codes.

Observability and Metrics
- Capture latency, error rates, and request counts.
- Export metrics to a standard system (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry).

Testing APIs and AI endpoints
- Write tests that cover happy paths and edge cases.
- Mock heavy ML workloads to keep tests fast.

Performance and Scaling
- Use asynchronous endpoints where appropriate.
- Offload long-running tasks to background workers if needed.
- Use pagination for large result sets.

Tools, Templates, and Reusable Components
- Create a reusable set of endpoints and schemas for common AI tasks.
- Maintain a library of validators and utilities.

Reusable components checklist
- A base Pydantic schema for standard responses.
- A generic error model.
- A small data access layer with common CRUD helpers.
- A service layer for business logic that can be tested independently.

Contributing and Governance
- Document how to contribute, how to run tests, and how to propose changes.
- Use a code style guide and a lightweight review process.
- Maintain a changelog with releases and notable changes.
